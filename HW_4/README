Notes:
Both types of colliders are implemented.
Walking to the river causes Gisela to stop moving(Box Collider).
Walking next to the Unlit torch on the left side of the map lights it(Circle Collider).
^ The bottom right of the torch
The Waterfalls and Right Torch are Particle Effects that are unmodifiable in game.

Only new input command is the 'F', to use a spellcast, for reasons unknown to me the
spell doesn't appear, although I've kept some diagnostic printed notes to prove the cast

One addition of note is overhauling the movement a bit to accomodate colliders, and have
added a char as the way to determine the direction Gisela is walking and as a way to help
With the input of spellcasts

Overall, I think I'll need to tidy up some things to make the engine work more seamlessly,
As well as add some elements like attacking and damage, but for where I'm at right now
I think it is satisfactory.

Enjoy!
