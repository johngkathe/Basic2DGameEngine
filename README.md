# Basic2DGameEngine
This is a what I worked on for a 2D game engine development course in college using the SDL2 library for C++.  After enlisting the help of some teammates we got some more work done, but I wanted to show my individual work here.

Should you want to play around with this, you will have to provide the SDL2 (2.0.12) and SDL2 image library files yourself.  Feel free to do whatever you want with the code, but limit all sprite art usage to personal use only.
